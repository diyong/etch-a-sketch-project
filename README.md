# etch-a-sketch-project
Creating an etch-a-sketch using JavaScript and CSS

In this project, I further strengthened my understanding of DOM, JavaScript, and CSS layouts. I decided to use flexbox for the header, and, seeing as how the etch-a-sketch can be easily imagined as a grid, CSS Grid for the body of the etch-a-sketch.

I learned how to manipulate CSS attributes on the fly using event listeners in JavaScript. I also learned how to manipulate an unknown quantity of elements through DOM methods. I have also learned additional techniques to create a reactive layout through the use of the "vh" and "vw" units.
